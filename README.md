# The Mandalorian

The Mandalorian is a simple website designed to show the series` third season trailer using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

## What I learned

With this project I was able to learn the basics of coding a website and adding it to GitHub. I'm really excited to post new projects and gain more knowledge of coding!

## This is my first project of all!

Opinions and tips of all kinds are welcome!
